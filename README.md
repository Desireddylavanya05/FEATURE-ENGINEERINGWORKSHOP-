# FEATURE-ENGINEERINGWORKSHOP-

🚀 Feature Engineering Workshop
Welcome to the Feature Engineering Workshop! This hands-on project demonstrates how transforming raw features into more meaningful representations can significantly improve model performance. The notebook showcases practical applications using polynomial and interaction features in a regression setting.

📌 Workshop Overview
This workshop covers:

The importance of feature engineering in machine learning.

How polynomial and interaction features can reveal hidden patterns.

Evaluating model improvements through metrics like RMSE and R².

🧠 Learning Objectives
By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to:

Understand the limitations of simple linear models.
